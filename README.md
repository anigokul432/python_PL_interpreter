# python_PL_interpreter
An interpreter built in Python for a lisp-like programming language. This interpreter can handle expressions (logical, arithmetic, comparison), variables, console input/output, functions, classes (with methods), recursion, etc.

There are some sample programs in the interpreterv1.py file. Running interpreterv1.py can run the particular test cases and get the output.

You can also run the command `python3 tester.py 1` and this will run 5 test cases that test recursion, setting variables, 2 error cases, and user input/output.
